            "content": "Hippel, Eric von, and Georg von Krogh. “Free Revealing and the Private-Collective Model for Innovation Incentives.” R and D Management 36, no. 3 (June 2006): 295–306. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9310.2006.00435.x . Abstract: . A central tenant of open innovation is free revealing of the detailed workings of novel products and services, so that others may use them, learn from them, and perhaps improve them as well. We explain that innovators frequently do freely reveal proprietary information and knowledge regarding both information-based products and physical products they have developed. We explain why free revealing can make good economic sense for innovators and for society as well. The article develops the case for free revealing in terms of a ‘private collective’ model of innovation incentives. . Main Arguments: . Collective inventions (Allen, 1983) provide early evidences of free revealing in 19th century English Iron Industry and Mine Engine design (Nuvolari, 2004) in physical products. Free revealing is wide-spread in other industrial, medical, sports equipment products, while open source software depends on free revealing of the source code to exist, sometimes this kind of intentional and routine irrational behaviors even take place regardless of the competing relationship among the profit-seeking firms. . Some practical cases could be made to explain the free revealing for innovation: . When others know something close to ‘your’ secret, it’s very possible that many firms and individuals may have similar information (inevitable innovations), cost to maintain your trade secret could become too high to be practical. . | When profits from patenting are low, i.e. weak appropriability to profit directly from the temporary monopoly granted from patent (Teece, 2003). . | When incentives for free revealing are positive: . Free revealing help to create awareness about the innovation (increased adoption, network effect) . | increase the rate of collective learning, rapid development of better design (quickly become dominant design to preempt competitions) . | It’s hard to control the knowledge, given free-flowing of engineers and supply chain cooperation . | Reputation gained from free-revealing, increased value and potential profit from related complementary assets . | Sharing enable manufacturers and users community collectively improve the innovation both up and down stream, ultimately helps everybody. . | . | . Given the observation, a private-collective model of innovation incentive is proposed to account for the limit in Private Investment and Collective Action model dichotomy. . . Key Assumption: . Innovators gain more profits than free riders from freely-revealed innovations because some sources of profit remain private. . Participation in the community brings intrinsic private benefits, such as learning, enjoyment and sense of ownership | . Adopting the private-collective model will bring the “best of both worlds” in which public goods are produced at private expense. Innovators relinquish control of knowledge produced, but at the same time gain private profits, so public subsidy is not required. . Questions . The distinction between collective action model and private-collective model is the assumption that innovators profit more than free-rider, since the intrinsic rewards also exist in collective action model, can we measure the specific additional extrinsic private profit? . | The happy middle ground that offer society “the best of the both worlds” seems too good to be obtained without any cost/efforts, what’s the catch? When will it fail? . | David Teece (1986) introduced the decision tree model for integration vs. contract for profiting from innovation, given the conditions of complementary assets and appropriability regime. What are firm’s best strategy to profit from open user innovation? When to free reveal as a strategy/weapon? Google does OSS right. Open source to commoditize your competitor&#39;s advantages, not to strengthen your own. [By anonymous] . | . References . Allen, R.C. (1983) Collective invention.

            "content": "Reiss, Steven. Myths of Intrinsic Motivation, 2013. ISBN: 978-0-9891701-0-9 . Absctract: . One scientist’s answer to Daniel Pink’s book, Drive, which claims that extrinsic incentives – money, bonuses, praise, and recognition – have the paradoxical effect of lessening intrinsic motivation. Reiss cites multiple flaws with the underlying science, discusses studies and scholarly literature reviews not mentioned in Pink’s book, and cites respected researchers who do not believe that extrinsic incentives undermine intrinsic motivation. . Main arguments: . The term undermining theory refers collectively to self-perception theory, overjustifcation theory, cognitive evaluation theory, and self-determination theory in social psychology, which predict the use of rewards and incentives undermines intrinsic motivation, and view rewards, bonus, and incentives are perceived as efforts to control. Reiss believe the undermining effect are simply well-know negative effects of rewards, such as distraction, performance anxiety. . Criticisms of social psychology of motivation: . Extrinsic motivation have no construct validity, three components distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation do not exist: | (extrinsic) means versus (intrinsic) ends: means drive their motivational properties from ends . | (intrinsic) psychological versus (extrinsic) biological needs: Cognition brain science says every need is part biological and part psychological. There’s only one reward mechanism. . | the analysis of psychological needs as competence, autonomy and relatedness is arbitrary . | . No reliable and valid measures of the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation: | Results of behavioral freechoice assessments depend on the available options in the environment in which the assessments are conducted. The measures of intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation are open to circular interpretation. . The studies lacked adequate experimental controls and scientific robustness | The studies confounded the controlling and distracting aspects of rewards. Reiss and Sushinsky (1975, 1976) suggested that undermining effects can be reinterpreted as annoying distractions conditioned to the task through Pavlovian association. . Claims of practical significance for education and business are greatly exaggerated | Almost all studies are distracting reward given once, the long term effect is still not clear. The theory cannot imply that base salaries can undermine intrinsic motivation. . Most people are not motivated by self-determination until it is taken away. They sometimes may view rewards as controlling, but it is much more common for people to see their pursuit of rewards and incentives as freely determined. Eisenberger et al. (1999) were right when they wrote “reward increases perceived self-determination” (p. 677). Evaluating the effects of reward on task interest is worth pursuing. It is best studied, however, without distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation . References: . Reiss, S., &amp; Sushinsky, L.W. (1976).

            "content": "Lakhani, Karim, and Robert G. Wolf. “Why Hackers Do What They Do: Understanding Motivation and Effort in Free/Open Source Software Projects.” SSRN Electronic Journal, 2003. https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.443040. . Abstract: . In this paper we report on the results of a study of the effort and motivations of individuals to contributing to the creation of Free/Open Source software. We used a Web-based survey, administered to 684 software developers in 287 F/OSS projects, to learn what lies behind the effort put into such projects. Academic theorizing on individual motivations for participating in F/OSS projects has posited that external motivational factors in the form of extrinsic benefits (e.g.: better jobs, career advancement) are the main drivers of effort. We find in contrast, that enjoyment-based intrinsic motivation, namely how creative a person feels when working on the project, is the strongest and most pervasive driver. We also find that user need, intellectual stimulation derived from writing code, and improving programming skills are top motivators for project participation. A majority of our respondents are skilled and experienced professionals working in IT-related jobs, with approximately 40 percent being paid to participate in the F/OSS project. . Main arguments: . Respondents were primarily male (97.5%) with an average age of 30 years and living primarily in the developed Western world, 58% of the respondents were directly involved in the IT industry. . | “paid contributors” consisting of approximately 40% of the sample, Overall, paid contributors are spending more than two working days a week and volunteer contributors are spending more than a day a week on F/OSS projects. . | All three major categories of motivations are confirmed to present in OSS participation: . enjoyment-based intrinsic motivations | obligation/community-based intrinsic motivations | extrinsic motivations. | | . User needs for the software, is the overwhelming reason for contribution and participation. The top single reason to contribute to projects is based on enjoyment-related intrinsic motivation, “Project code is intellectually stimulating to write” (44.9%). Improving programming skills, an extrinsic motivation related to human capital improvement, was a close second (41.8%). Self-identification with the hacker community and ethic drive participation. . A sense of personal creativity is the biggest determinant of effort in F/OSS projects, this sense of creativity is endogenous and heterogeneous to the people within projects. | . While there are significant differences in motivations between paid contributors and volunteers, contrary to experimental findings on the negative impact of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivations, dominant motives do not crowd out or spoil others. . There was no significant impact on the hours per week dedicated based on the interaction of being paid and feeling creative. Hours per week dedicated to a project did not decline given, that those who are paid to contribute code are also feeling creative in that project. . Questions: . There should be a lot of research opportunities using OSS community, survey or NLP and SNA based analysis, given the aboudant activity data in OSS community fourm and code repositories. It would be also interesting to do meta-analysis with these types of studies, track the changes over time, as some organization like Linux Foundation do annual FOSS Contributor Survey. . | There are already significant differences seen between paid contributors and volunteers, better ways to distinguish them and more comparisons should reveal interesting findings. . | The observation that clusters of individuals motivated by extrinsic, intrinsic, or hybrid extrinsic/intrinsic factors probably mean that there are other intrinsic needs behind the extrinsic motivations 1 . | .

Abstract: . Empirical studies of innovation have found that end users frequently develop important product and process innovations. Defying conventional wisdom on the negative effects of uncompensated spillovers, innovative users also often openly reveal their innovations to competing users and to manufacturers. Rival users are thus in a position to reproduce the innovation in-house and benefit from using it, and manufacturers are in a position to refine the innovation and sell it to all users, including competitors of the user revealing its innovation. In this paper, we explore the incentives that users might have to freely reveal their proprietary innovations. We then develop a game-theoretic model to explore the effect of these incentives on users’ decisions to reveal or hide their proprietary information. We find that, under realistic parameter constellations, free revealing pays. We conclude by discussing some implications of our findings. . Main Arguments: . Analysis from a game theory economics model shows that under reasonable parameter settings, free revealing of innovation via manufacturers can be profitable for the innovators (with complementary capabilities/assets). . With relative low competition, high generality of the innovation, manufacturer’s increased capability to improve the innovation and lower the cost promotes both the free-revealing and the adoption of the innovation. . This model is also applicable to user-to-user transfers in which the receiving user creates an externality enjoyed by the sender. . Key Assumptions: . these user firms are identical with respect to all other aspects that bear on their profitability | none of the players has sufficient knowledge or information to produce the innovation on their own | it is not possible to reveal the innovation exclusively to the manufacturer | licensing is not feasible, and that there are no side payments between users and between innovator users and manufacturers | . Decision variables related to free revealing: . the intensity of the competition among users | the degree to which the innovation has a bias favoring the innovating user | the degree of the manufacturer improvements to the revealed innovation | the cost to user of adopting the improved commercial product | . Questions: . What happens if change/release the assumptions? Adaption to behavioral economics game to be played by human? to study impacts of loss aversion, cog From policy point of view, it would be interesting to study the specific situations where prisoner’s dilemma force them to reveal. .",

Research into free and open source software development projects has so far largely focused on how the major tasks of software development are organized and motivated. But a complete project requires the execution of “mundane but necessary” tasks as well. In this paper, we explore how the mundane but necessary task of ﬁeld support is organized in the case of Apache web server software, and why some project participants are motivated to provide this service gratis to others. We ﬁnd that the Apache ﬁeld support system functions effectively. We also ﬁnd that, when we partition the help system into its component tasks, 98% of the effort expended by information providers in fact returns direct learning beneﬁts to those providers. This ﬁnding considerably reduces the puzzle of why information providers are willing to perform this task “for free.” Implications are discussed. . Main arguments: . OS community organic field support system function effectively as evidenced in Apache community. . Almost all (98%) the effort expended by community information providers in fact return direct learning benefits to those providers themselves. The main motives to provide help are expected reciprocity, identification with the community cause, gain reputation or enhance career prospects, etc. One average, information providers involve quite small costs/time to answer posted questions.

Psychological Bulletin, 125(6), 627–668. https:// https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.627 . Abstract: . A meta-analysis of 128 studies examined the effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. As predicted, engagement-contingent, completion-contingent, and performance-contingent rewards significantly undermined free-choice intrinsic motivation (d = -0.40, -0.36, and -0.28, respectively), as did all rewards, all tangible rewards, and all expected rewards. Engagement-contingent and completioncontingent rewards also significantly undermined self-reported interest (d = -0.15, and —0.17), as did all tangible rewards and all expected rewards. Positive feedback enhanced both free-choice behavior (d = 0.33) and self-reported interest (d = 0.31). Tangible rewards tended to be more detrimental for children than college students, and verbal rewards tended to be less enhancing for children than college students. The authors review 4 previous meta-analyses of this literature and detail how this study’s methods, analyses, and results differed from the previous ones. . Main arguments: . A meta-analytic review first reviewed three previous meta-analysis that confirmed the effects of extrinsic rewards undermining intrinsic motivation, two reporting different conclusions, and find the most consistent finding was that task-contingent tangible rewards were detrimental to intrinsic motivation. 128 studies were aggregated to examine different reward types’ effects on intrinsic motivation, with results for the free-choice behavioral measure and the self-reported interest measure. specifically, as predicted, engagement-contingent rewards, completion-contingent rewards, and performance-contingent rewards significantly undermined free-choice intrinsic motivation, as did all rewards, tangible rewards and all expected rewards. . The meta-analysis provide strong confirmation that positive feedback enhances intrinsic motivation, which is predicted by cognitive evaluation theory (GET, later evolved into Self-Determination Theory, SDT). Substantially different results from informational vs. controlling verbal reward were found as well as predicted. . Key takeaway: . Reward and contingency types: . verbal (unexpected) reward | unexpected tangible reward | expected tangible reward: task-noncontigent, engagement-contingent, completion-contingent, performance-contingent | . Common measures for intrinsic motivation: . Free-choice behavior | Self-reported interest | . CET (Cognitive Evaluation Theory) predicts unexpected, non-controlled reward do not undermine intrinsic motivation, as not perceived as controlling the autonomy. . Task-contingent tangible rewards detrimental to intrinsic motivation . Expected tangible reward contingent on task performance undermine intrinsic motivation . Informational verbal rewards enhance intrinsic motivation . Autonomy, mastery, purpose are the end goals . Notes: . Chapter 8 of Reiss’ book of Myths of Intrinsic Motivation 1 were devoted to counter argue this meta-analysis: . Publication bias: no undermining research tend not to be published . Ceiling effects: many studies were significantly biased in favor of finding undermining effects because they pre-selected people with high levels of interest and due to ceiling effects could not measure when rewards further increased intrinsic interest. . Tips for motivation literature review: . We began by searching the PsycINFO and ERIC databases and recent editions of the Current Contents database for studies published between 1971 and August 1997. Varying combinations of the following search terms were entered: intrinsic motivation, rewards, reinforcement, free time, and free choice. . References: . Reiss, Steven.

Abstract: . Intrinsic and extrinsic types of motivation have been widely studied, and the distinction between them has shed important light on both developmental and educational practices. In this review we revisit the classic definitions of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation in light of contemporary research and theory. Intrinsic motivation remains an important construct, reflecting the natural human propensity to learn and assimilate. However, extrinsic motivation is argued to vary considerably in its relative autonomy and thus can either reflect external control or true self-regulation. The relations of both classes of motives to basic human needs for autonomy, competence and relatedness are discussed. . Main Arguments: . Extrinsic motivation: defined as a construct that pertains whenever an activity is done in order to attain some separable outcome. Self-determination Theory (SDT) proposes that extrinsic motivation can vary greatly in the degree of autonomy, ie. extrinsic motivation varies from controlling to autonomous/self-determined continuum) . . External regulation . Introjection: regulated by contingent self-esteem | Identification: ego involvement | Integration: through self-examination, and value assimilation | . More autonomous extrinsic motivation is associated with greater engagement, better performance, and greater psychological well-being. . Internalization and integration: Relatedness (facilitate identification?), competence facilitate more internalization, and autonomy facilitate integration of behavioral regulation (self-determined), however, feeling of competence alone will not enhance intrinsic motivation unless accompanied by a sense of autonomy. However, as extrinsic regulation become more internalized and self-determined, they do not transform into intrinsic motivation. . Questions: . &quot;Because extrinsically motivated behaviors are not inherently interesting and thus must initially be externally prompted, the primary reason people are likely to be willing to do the behaviors is that they are valued by (their instrumental value) significant others to whom they feel (or would like to feel) connected, whether that be a family, a peer group, or a society. &quot; Can this instrumental value behind the extrinsic motivation be somewhat intrinsic? . Why “as extrinsic regulation become more internalized and self-determined, they do not transform into intrinsic motivation”? &quot;because behavior motivated by integrated regulation is done for its presumed instrumental value with respect to some outcome that is separate from the behavior, even though it is volitional and valued by the self.&quot; .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
